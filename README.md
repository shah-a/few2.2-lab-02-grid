# FEW 2.2 Lab 2

Consider this exercise as a practice interview question. There are two parts: an on site question and a take home question. The take home question is at the bottom of this page [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3320-Web-Design-and-Advanced-CSS/blob/master/lessons/lesson-06.md#after-class).

Imagine you need to design a dashboard page for a new product. This page is divided into a grid. Below is an image showing what the final page might look like.
